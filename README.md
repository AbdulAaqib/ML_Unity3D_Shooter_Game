# ML_Unity3D_Shooter_Game
This is a Machine Learning project that I had created for my A-Level Computer Science NEA, where I had focused on applying the branch of Reinforcement Learning on a Zombie Game, which I had created.

•	Developed a Unity 3D Shooter Game with a focus on integrating Unity’s ML-Agent for simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents using deep reinforcement learning and imitation learning. Implemented a sophisticated ML-based zombie behaviour system using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in Unity.
•	Enhanced the learning process by optimizing hyperparameters, resulting in a 5% improvement in accuracy.
Utilized MLP neural networks to create an adaptive AI system that allowed zombies to learn from player interactions.
•	Designed the AI system to dynamically adjust zombie behaviour based on the player's actions, significantly increasing the game's realism and challenge. Resulting in strengthening my proficiency in implementing complex AI approaches within the Unity game development environment. Successfully completed the project, highlighting advanced skills in game development and machine learning integration.
